# On how to choose a stack

In 2007 I left a growing 70 person startup to found my own venture.  I was 26 and I knew everything I needed to know about web development and stacking chips. My stack choices were obvious:

Component | Choice | Regret 
----------|--------|--------
Language  | Ruby   | N
Web Framework | Merb | Y
Database | Postgres | N
Database | MongoDB | Y
JS Framework | MooTools | Y
Hosting Provider | SliceHost | Y
